Description: Profiling single cell gene expression data over specified time periods are increasingly applied to the study of complex developmental processes. Here, we describe a novel prototype-based dimension reduction method to visualize high throughput temporal expression data for single cell analyses.  Our software preserves the global developmental trajectories over a specified time course, and it also identifies subpopulations of cells within each time point demonstrating superior visualization performance over six commonly used methods.
